As I need to call Matlab scripts from the command, e.g., for running Matlab scripts in a batch, every once in a while, I post a little reminder for my self here.
Keep in mind that the called Matlab command needs to have an exit at the end, otherwise Matlab will keep running, waiting for input.
<!--break-->

In this example I am calling `myscript` and forward bash options `$1` and `$2` to it.
Furthermore I am suppressing the GUI (`-nodisplay`), the Java Virtual Machine (`-nojvm`), the splash screen (`-nosplash`) and the Matlab Desktop (`-nodesktop`).
Anyhow, the latte two options might be implied by suppressing the GUI already - but I'm not taking chances ;).

Note that you need to adjust your path to the `matlab` binary as well as change the script (`myscript(...)`) you want to call, if you simply copy & paste the line below.
And here's the command line:

<pre><code class="bash">/Applications/MATLAB_R2007b/bin/matlab -nodisplay -nojvm -nosplash -nodesktop -r 'myscript($var1,$var2); exit'</code></pre>

That's it again,
