Some days ago, I [reported][1] about my freezing Mac while using Logic Pro 8 and upgrading to Logic Pro 9 to avoid the problem.
However, in the meanwhile, the same problems occured with Logic Pro 9 and I was almost getting up the wall about all this stuff, but then fortunately, I stumbled over an [RME forum thread][2] (beware, it's German!), discussing somewhat similar issues.

Finally, it seems like that I have to hope for Snow Leopard to fix a problem with Firewire and I hope Apple will do this, as the RME guys claim their drivers to be waterproof :]

My workaround for now is to switch on the Fireface beforehand switching on the Mac. That's it so far from freezing Fred :)
