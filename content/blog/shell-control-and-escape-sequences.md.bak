<!--more-->
Again, as a reminder for myself I am posting a table of shell control & escape sequences to navigate and use a misconfigured, non-configured shell or just for bragging purposes.
<!--break-->

For sure this table is not comprehensive. Please drop a comment if there is a sequence, which needs to be added and will gladly add a line!

 Sequence | Description              
 -------- | :---------------------   
 Ctrl-A   | Beginning of line        
 Ctrl-E   | End of line              
 Ctrl-U   | Clear line               
 Ctrl-K   | Clear line from cursor   
 Ctrl-W   | Delete last word       
 Esc-D    | Delete next word       
 Ctrl-R   | Incremental history back search 
 Ctrl-G   | Cancel history search

Best,
