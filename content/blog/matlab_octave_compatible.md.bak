<!--more-->
Some days ago, I needed to write an m-file ([Matlab™][1] Function File), which had to run under [Octave][2] as well.
If you use full Octave compliant stuff, this works quite easily without modification of your code. 
But if you use e.g. subplot(...) with a range to make one plot broader or wider, Octave resigns. 
Therefore, I put in the following statement and wrote this blog message as a reminder :)
<!--break-->

	if exist('OCTAVE_VERSION')
	  figure
	else
	  subplot( 4,1,[2:4] )
	end

This runs under both, Matlab™ and Octave. Hope, this helped...

Cheers, iss
