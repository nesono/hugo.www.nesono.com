I know it's almost common sense, but today I had to refix the slow GUI for Matlab yet another time.
As the information seems to start vanishing from the web, I want to perpetuate it here.

Go into directory `/Applications/MATLAB_R2007b/bin/maci` (or wherever your installation resides) and create a file called `java.opts` with the following content.

	-Dapple.awt.graphics.UseQuartz=true
