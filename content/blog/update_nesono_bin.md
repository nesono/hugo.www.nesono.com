<!--more-->
If you want to update nesono-bin, I would recommend you to use the following command inside the nesono-bin directory (especially if you made some editing):

<pre class="brush:bash">git pull --rebase</pre>

If you encounter conflicts, you will need to solve them first to continue the rebase, of course.
