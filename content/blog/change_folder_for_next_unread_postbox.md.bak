While trying <a href="http://www.postbox-inc.com/" target="_blank">Postbox</a> under Mac, I soon realized it's a thunderbird derivative. However, using Thunderbird I was able to use the 'N' short cut to switch to next unread message no matter in which folder it resides. After senseless searches in the virtual Postbox documentation, I searched for it at Mozilla and found the result instantly. However, you need to edit the configuration by hand, which seems a bit nerdy for a comfortable Mac Application.

Therefore, open Postbox' preferences and switch to **Advanced-&gt;General**, press **Config Editor...** at the bottom and insert nav in the search field after pledging to be carefull. Then only one line should be left in the list below, labeled **mailnews.nav_crosses_folders**. Change it's value to **1** and that's it.

Cheers,
