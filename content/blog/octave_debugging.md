I just found a nice site about Octave debugging. It told me about the following two functions, which are very nice for debugging, which is a pretty pitty in Octave in contrast to Matlab :/

	debug_on_warning(1)
	debug_on_error(1)

If you want to add a breakpoint to your function at a speciÔ¨Åc line, use the following statement

	dbstop('yourfunctionname',1)

Then you can use the dbxxx commands to debug your code:

	dbstep
	dbcont
	dbnext
	...

Happy debugging!
