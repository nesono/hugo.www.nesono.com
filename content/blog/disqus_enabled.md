<!--more-->
I just enabled support for [Disqus][dq], as I think this should be much nicer for most of you, not having to give bogus user names and homepage links etc. but simply use one [Disqus][dq] account. I kept the old comments active, but did not manage to merge them into Disqus, though. Hence, you'll probably see two comment counters on some posts sometimes.

It's been too easy to integrate, so I won't start a blog post on that. You'll get good information on the [Disqus][dq] homepage.

If you prefer to use the old system anyway, please drop me a [message](/user/4/contact) and I'll change it back, probably ;)

Cheerio,
iss
