<p class="rtejustify">Even though the title seems to exaggerate slightly, I need to say, that the 33 minutes OS X Lion claims to need for installation - and it does not correct itself by measuring the time - can never be reached with hard drives, at least not for an upgrade. For my first installation, I was waiting for 75 minutes and the second installation tells me that 28 minutes are left (after 40 'real' minutes).</p>

<p class="rtejustify">Anyhow, here is the useful part of this post: Do not think your installation is frozen, hangs at some problem or something really bad happened. It's just OS X Liar ;)</p>
