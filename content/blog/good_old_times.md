I just saw a video from my old band - made by our singer fludid - which reminded me of good old times with my band mcf. It really makes me kind of melancholic and wistful. It includes so many lovely people we met, we played with, we worked with, so many years of traveling, laughing, crazy stuff and so much fun...
