Today I found out some features of the Skype chat that must have sneaked in in the last versions, since nobody has posted about it yet.
I was having a hard time when pasting text into the chat which contained character that were easily misinterpreted as emoticons, e.g. (0) as well as using basic text formatting like bold, italic or strikethrough.

<!--break--> 
So here are my findings, I also posted on [SuperUser][1]:

Style                            | Example
-------------------------------- | ----------------------
**bold**                         | This is `*bold*` text
_italic_                         | This is `_italic_` text
<strike>strikethrough</strike>   | This is `~strikethrough~` text
`plain text` inline              | Use this for inline `{code}no text formatting, no emoticons, monospaced text{code}`
                                 | or like this: `` ```no text formatting, no emoticons, monospaced text``` ``
`plain text` full                | `!! no text formatting, no emoticons, monospaced text`
`no text formatting`             | `@@ *no text formatting* but emoticons :D`


NB: Use Shift+Return if you want to insert a carriage return instead of sending the message (thanks to Mr Lister).  
Thanks to `Shrek` for the two options (`@@`, and `{code}`).  
Thanks to Michael Balanov for the hint about using three backticks (`` ``` ``) instead of `{code}`.  
That's it again,
