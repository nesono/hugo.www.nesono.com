Since I happen to forget this every once in a while and end up in trying to debug in the command line but no symbols and no source is found, I drop a message for my future me:
<!--break-->
"Run lldb inside the xcrun enviroment:"

<pre><code class="bash">xcrun lldb [binary]</code></pre>

This seems to work fine for Xcode, Unix Makefiles (gmake), as well as ninja projects (created with CMake). Cheers,
