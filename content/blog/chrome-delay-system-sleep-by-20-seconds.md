<p>I am just wondering who sees this effect as well: Chrome delays the sleep for 20 seconds on any mac. It seems to be an open <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Chrome/thread?tid=7b1799e346b50273&amp;hl=en">issue</a>. However, I would have never imagined that a browser could be so intriguing :D</p>
