<p style="text-align: justify; ">I just changed my helper script, which moves the specified files into Trash instead of deleting them directly to use the Finder by calling AppleScript. This change now enables the Put Back feature from Mac OS X Trash, which was not available using the method before. Get a copy from <a href="https://github.com/nesono/nesono-bin/blob/master/bashtils/rm2trash.darwin" target="_blank">github</a> and enjoy. Apart from that, I fixed the behaviour for symbolic links pointing to files with whitespaces (nobody does such things, but now you could).</p><p style="text-align: justify; ">Cheerio,<br>iss</p>
