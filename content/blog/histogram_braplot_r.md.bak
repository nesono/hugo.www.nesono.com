<!--more-->
To create a stem plot, barplot (with filled bars), or a histogram, there is a simple method in R which provides a flexible alternative to the full blown barplot and histogram plots.
It's even easier when it comes to composing multiple graphs in one plot.
<!--break-->

Simply use the type `h` to create a stem plot:
<pre><code class="R">plot( type='h', ... )</code></pre>
In case you want to have a barplot or histogram it's wise to use square line endings and change the line width (requires tweaking):
<pre><code class="R">plot( type='h', lend=2, lwd=30 )</code></pre>

That's it
