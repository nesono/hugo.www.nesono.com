Today I installed clang_complete using [Pathogen][1] (i.e., I installed it as a submodule of my dotfiles git repository aka [nesono-bin][2].
I tried to be smart and went into the submodule's directory and invoked `make install`.
That nicely built the *vimball* and installed itself - but whenever I tried to open a `cpp`-file I got the following error:

<pre><code class="bash">"/tmp/sample.cpp" 10L, 144C
Error detected while processing function <SNR>15_ClangCompleteInit..<SNR>15_initClangCompletePython:
line   29:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/iss/nesono-bin/vim/bundle/clang_complete/plugin/libclang.py", line 63, in initClangComplete
    Config.set_compatibility_check(False)
  File "/Users/iss/nesono-bin/vim/plugin/clang/cindex.py", line 3126, in set_compatibility_check
    raise Exception("compatibility_check must be set before before " \
Exception: compatibility_check must be set before before using any other functionalities in libclang.
line   30:
E121: Undefined variable: l:res
E15: Invalid expression: l:res == 0</code></pre>

The error message was caused by the fact, that vim was loading `clang_complete` twice, as it was now installed in the `bundle` directory **and** in the `plugin` directory.  
To fix this issue, I deleted all `clang_complete` related files:

<pre><code class="bash">bin/
doc/clang_complete.txt
doc/tags
plugin/clang/
plugin/clang_complete.vim
plugin/libclang.py
plugin/snippets/</code></pre>

Everything worked pretty fine from now on.  
That's it again
