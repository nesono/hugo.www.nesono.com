<p>&nbsp;You can find my timecode4 application now on sourceforge! Just follow the link below and browse through the fresh project administration.</p>
<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/timecode4" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/timecode4</a></p>
<p>I moved the stuff from my local svn to sourceforge. Maybe it's better to have free software in a free enviroment... ;)</p>
