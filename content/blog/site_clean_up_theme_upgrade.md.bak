<!--more-->
Here is my new zen theme based on drupal 7 - to which I upgraded my old site. The theme has been completely redesigned towards good readability. Its design is encouraged by applications like Instapaper, Read it Later or browser extensions like Safari's Reader or Chrome's iReader.

<!--break-->
If you are curious about details of the theme, you can find it 
[online](https://github.com/nesono/nesono.drupal7 "github/nesono.drupal7") on github. Anyhow, I will post some details about the upgrade process and some information about the theme in the near future, so stay tuned!

Apart from the updates, I removed several pages which were outdated or simply none of your business ;) I hope you like the new look of *nesono.com* and come back soon to check for new posts (if you don't like polling, you can subscribe to the RSS feed at the bottom).

Cheers,
