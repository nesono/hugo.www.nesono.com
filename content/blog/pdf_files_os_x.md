Today I needed to merge and encrypt multiple PDF files into one and thought to remember it to be an easy task.
Well, it is actually, but with some things to keep in mind and hence this post.
So, if you want to merge PDF files in Mac OS X, you can do the following:

1. Open all PDF files, either
  1. one by one, or
  1. all at once
1. Drag and drop 
  1. Single pages (using the side bar) or
  1. Full Documents (using the proxy icon from the window title)
1. Drop them into the side bar page preview
  1. If you drop on the upper half, the contents are prepended
  1. If you drop on the lower half, the contents are appended.

This might seem complex, but it is pretty intuitive, as long as you keep in mind to drop the page *on top* of the other. That's it again.

Cheers,
