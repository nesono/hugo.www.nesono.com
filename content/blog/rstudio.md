Some days ago I found a nice GUI for R: [RStudio][1]! 
It works as it should always have been: with a workspace/data browser, script editor (with source on save), documentation viewer, file browser, and a plot view. 
If you already feel familar with R, you should definately check it out, it will probably second your workflow as hell. 
At least it did for me...

Cheers,
