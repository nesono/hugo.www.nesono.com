<!--more-->
If you see strange symbols in [iTerm][1] when using [vim][2], especially with the [NERD Tree][3] and [Undo Tree][4], or in [tig][5], a super fast and flexible curses-based git interface, or simply when typing non ASCII characters in iTerm, you might want to add this to your shell config file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, ...):
<!--break-->

<code class='bash'>export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8</code>

Do not forget to restart your shell!  
That's it,
