<!--more-->
After doing some background upgrading for my dot-files project - also called nesono-bin as there are many helper scripts in there - I though it might be good to list the new features in one list, since the features mostly creeped in over the last weeks:
<!--break-->

* Cygwin/MinGW support (yes, I need to use Windows sometimes now)
* FreeBDS support (yes, I still try to be cool)
* Supporting different installation directory than `$HOME`
* vim configuration stuff (bundles, themes, plugin handling, etc.)
* mercurial (`hg`) support in prompt

Cheerio,
