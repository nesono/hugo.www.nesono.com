<p>After Apple's Java Update that came with <em>Mac OS X 10.6.8</em>, Matlab (R2008 and older) crashes whenever a figure or plot is opened. According to <a href="http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/309912" target="_blank">Matlab Central</a>, you can fix the problem with the correct DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH during Matlab launch. For our convenience, I merged it into the Start Matlab.app, archived it and attached it to this post.</p>
