<!--more-->
I just figured out once more, that vim works as expected. If you need to insert the output (e.g., stdout) from a command into the open buffer, e.g. to insert a certain type of files into something like .gitignore, svn::ignore, .cvsignore, you can simply type
<!--break-->

	:r !ls *.aux

In command mode and the text will be inserted at the cursor position.

Cheers,
