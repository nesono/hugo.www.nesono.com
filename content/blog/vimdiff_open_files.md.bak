<!--more-->
Often I found myself starting an extra vimdiff session while I am actually working in another [vim][1] session. Finally, I took the time to search for a solution and I came up with the following two lines in my `.vimrc`:
<!--break-->

<pre><code class="vimscript">nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;dt :windo diffthis<cr>
nnoremap &lt;leader&gt;do :windo diffo<cr></code></pre>

They blindly go through all windows in the current view and enables or disable vimdiff, so use them with caution if you are a split view junky.

That's it,
