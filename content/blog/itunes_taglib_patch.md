<p><img width="150" height="101" rel="lightbox" src="/sites/default/files/images/taglib_logo.png" style="margin: 0pt 10px; float: left;" alt="" />Well, some time ago, I wrote a patch for <a href="http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html">taglib</a> 1.4 for reading <a href="http://www.apple.com/de/itunes/">iTunes</a> tags from m4a and m4p files, created with iTunes, bought from the iTunes Store or what else. Now, as taglib reached 1.5 status, I updated the patch, encouraged by Steven Lau to adjust the patch towards version 1.5. Steve integrated the patch then into the music player <a href="http://getsongbird.com/">Songbird</a>. The patch for taglib version 1.5 is available <a href="/sites/default/files/taglib-1.5-m4a.diff.gz">here... </a></p>
