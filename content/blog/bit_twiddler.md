Yesterday I found a site called [The Bit Twiddler][1] while searching for an algorithm to calculate the bit population of an `int` in `C`. To me, it was quite like breaking a butterfly on the wheel, but it was very interesting and good to know for everybody who needs to twiddle with bits... But check it out yourself!

Cheers, iss.
