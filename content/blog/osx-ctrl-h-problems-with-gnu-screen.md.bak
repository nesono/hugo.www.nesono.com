Today I found the issue of a problem, I struggled for quite a while!
With my Mac logging into my server and running some GNU Screen session on it, I had problems with backspace.
It was either interpreted as delete, or not interpreted at all.
Setting the *Preferences of Mac's Terminal to Ctrl-H* sending was not the solution either, as this disabled all special characters (using option-u for example).
Furthermore, I noticed several crashes of my ssh sessions.

Finally, I recognized, that the ssh client I was using was taken from `/opt/local/bin` instead of `/usr/bin`.
MacPorts has installed a new ssh client over mine "original" one.
So my solution was simply to change the ssh client by modifying the PATH variable.
Maybe this is not a solution for all time, but for today I'm fine ;)

**[UPDATE]** Finally, I found the actual issue here! 
When running `irssi` from screen directly, the TERM environment variable is not set.
Thus, I added the following function to my zshrc (bashrc should work the same way) and the problem was gone.
No more backspace problems under both irssi and vim!

	SCREENBIN=$(which screen)
	echo "using screen bin: ${SCREENBIN}"
	
	# function to fix screen Delete/Ctrl-H  problem
	function screen()
	{
	  OLDTERM=${TERM} && TERM=screen && ${SCREENBIN} $@ && TERM=${OLDTERM}
	}

Cheers,
