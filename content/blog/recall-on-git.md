As noted in a previous [blog](/node/203), I am using git to work remotely on my svn repositories. 
Hence, I am able to commit changes into a git changeset and apply these changes to the svn repository as soon as I am back online again.
Anyhow, git is a bit different from centralized source code management systems - at least for me - and so I found another nice resource in the web, describing a git workflow (of GNOME):

[live.gnome.org](http://live.gnome.org/Git/Developers)

It also uses console colors for the diff's etc. (BTW, I did not need to set `LESS=-R` on my Mac OS X 10.5)

Cheers, iss
