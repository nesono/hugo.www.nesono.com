<p class="rtejustify">Just want to note, that the previous post about solving Matlab crashes whenever a figure or plot command is called after a Mac OS X Java update has an update by Mathworks itself. Check this <a href="http://www.mathworks.de/support/solutions/en/data/1-F37IJB/index.html" target="_blank">link</a> and learn how to solve the problem also for older Mac OS X versions!</p>
