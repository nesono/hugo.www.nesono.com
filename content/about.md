## About


ok then, you clicked on the 'about' menu link. then you might want to know, what this page is all about. simply spoken, <em>this is my personal page</em> containing several things i made over the years. i just needed a nice name, representing all my stuff, not being my family name ;)

and, as you clicked on 'about', you might want to know what's behind the name <b>nesono</b>. the following paragraphs try to give you a small-philosophical glimpse about the name and its origin: <cite>music and arts can be considered as being the orchestration of sounds, colors or any 'filling' media imaginable. within this perspective, a picture would be the composition of brush and pencil strokes with all shapes and colors, forming a painting, becoming the work of art. music is defined by all tones, tunes and rhythms played by the separate instruments to form a more or less homogenic sound.</cite>

<a href="/sites/default/files/images/450px-Flag_of_Esperanto.svg_.png" title="Esperanto Flag"><img alt="Esperanto Flag: esperanto flag" class="image image-thumbnail" rel="lightbox" src="/sites/default/files/imagecache/thumbnail/images/450px-Flag_of_Esperanto.svg_.png" style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 10px; float: right; width: 100px; height: 67px; " title="Esperanto Flag: esperanto flag" /></a><cite>people might forget, that any sound is not as present as it should, if there is no silence. mellow tones gain no presence, if there exists no disharmony in any way and a rhythm can never be produced without the discrete missing sounds in between each rhythm stroke. this point of view of lacking sounds is, what <b>nesono</b> stands for. <b>nesono</b> means 'no sound' in esperanto and stands for the alternate way of the definition of music.</cite>

and now we can discover the meaning of the <em>two slashes</em> ('//') to the right of the title. this is the music notation sign for 'break' (ital/esp: cesura, de: z&auml;sur) denoting to <em>play</em> a break in a song.

but enough small minds for now. now as you know the idea behind the scenes, feel free to enjoy yourself on this website. it does not always relate to music and not always relate to the the <b>nesono</b> attitude. generally spoken: <b>nesono</b> is just my personal website ;)
